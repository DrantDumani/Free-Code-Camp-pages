    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      When Susie was a young girl, she lived with her father, Max Profitt Haltmann, who was the CEO and founder of Haltmann Works Co. While her father was experimenting with the capabilities of the company's mother computer, Star Dream, a terrible accident occurred. Susie was flung to another dimension, but her father believed her to be lost for good. In his grief, he placed all of his efforts into reactivating Star Dream in order to grant his greatest wish: To bring his daughter back to life. Experimenting with the incomplete machine caused him to slowly lose his memories.

    <h2>Return to the company</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Susie eventually returned to the company a few years later. She passed their qualifications exam with ease and was hired by the company. By this time, President Haltmann had lost all of his memories of her and did not recognize her as his daughter. Even so, she became his secretary and executive assistant. Susie was responsible for planning major company ventures, designing business suits, and budget managing.

      <h2>Planet Pop Star Invasion</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
  Following the company's goal of eternal prosperity, Haltmann Works Co. began mechanizing planets and stripping them of their natural resources. Susie was placed in charge of the Pop Star mechanization project. Initially, the invasion was a major success and she faced little opposition. Nearly all of the planet's natives were mechanized in only a day, including one of Pop Star's finest warriors, Meta Knight, whose swordsmanship impressed Susie. She was even able to gather extensive research on Dreamland's monarch, producing amazing results from Star Dream.

        However, one small, pink lifeform posed a consistent threat to the project. Riding in one of the company's own robobot armor suits, this lifeform severely impeded the project's progress by causing billions in damages to both business ventures and the company HQ itself. The pink lifeform proved himself to be Susie's greatest obstacle. The possibility of her stopping him alone was slim. However, ever the opportunist, Susie would soon use his efforts to her advantage.

      <h2>Betrayal and the end of history</h2>
      <hr>
    <p>
      While she carried out all of her duties as secretary, Susie had much disdain for what had become of her father. Experimenting with the mother computer hadn't only caused him to lose his memories, he was nothing like the man she remembered before the accident. For a long time, Susie planned to bring him back to his senses by stealing Star Dream from him and selling it off. She hoped that doing so would teach him a lesson too.
    </p>
      <p>
        The opportunity came when President Haltmann himself decided to deal with the pink lifeform personally. He was bested in combat, and resorted to activating Star Dream in order to end the lifeform's interference. It was at this moment that Susie stole Star Dream from him, but she could only relish in her victory for so long. Using her own father's body as a host, Star Dream had become self aware. It determined that, in order to achieve the company's goal of eternal prosperity, that organic lifeforms were a liability. Starting with President Haltmann, it set out to wipe out all life in the universe. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking quickly, Susie allied with the pink lifeform. Opting to save the universe at the cost of the company headquarters, she gave the lifeform a robobot armor and had him destroy Star Dream in a last ditch effort. Thus, Susie was responsible for helping to save the universe. Though her father ultimately lost his life in the struggle.

      <h2>Current</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Following the death of Haltmann, Susie assumed the role of Haltmann Works Co. CEO. Ultimately, the Pop Star invasion ended in complete and total failure. All company assets were obliterated and the mechanized employees, which made up 98% of the company's workforce, ceased to function once Star Dream was destroyed. Company stock plummeted. No one expected Susie alone to be able to pick up the pieces. It seemed as though the end of Haltmann Works Co. was at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        But miraculously, Susie did it. Without the aid of Star Dream, Susie was able to completely restore the company. Haltmann Works Co. is once again one of the largest grossing companies in the solar system. In honor of her father, Susie continues to plan business ventures that involve invading, mechanizing, and strip mining planets. It remains unknown if she will ever invade Pop Star again, as she is now on good terms with the pink lifeform. However, it cannot be denied that in the face of adversity, she did everything she could to achieve overwhelming success.
